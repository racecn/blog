# 🌌 S3 - Real-Time Solar System Simulation

The real-time solar system simulation project aims to provide a modern, interactive tool for users to explore and understand our local solar system. This educational tool offers an engaging experience for learners (middle school and above), featuring realistic planetary appearances and accurate information to ensure an immersive learning experience.

## 🚀 Features

### Design
- 📷 **Manipulating the Camera in 3D Space:** Users can move, zoom, pan, or rotate the camera to view celestial objects and planetary interactions.
- 💡 **Lighting System:** Shadows and basic reflections are cast from planet to planet, with all light in the simulation provided by the Sun.
- 🔄 **Realistic Planetary Motion & Orbits:** Orbital information, speeds, and rotations are based on current positional data of planets, moons, and other space objects.

### Tasks
- ➕ **Create New Object with an Orbit of the User's Choice:** Users can create new objects within the simulation, specifying parameters like mass, size, initial velocity, and orbit characteristics.
- 👁️ **Hide and Show Objects:** Users can manage the visibility of objects, choosing to hide or show individual objects or groups.
- ⏯️ **Pause, Resume, Fast-Forward Simulation:** Users can manipulate the flow of time within the simulation, pausing, resuming, or fast-forwarding to observe specific moments or events.
- 💾 **Saving Features:** Users can save their current simulation state for future reference, including object positions, velocities, and other parameters.
- 🎮 **Interactive Camera Control:** Users can adjust the camera perspective dynamically to focus on specific objects or regions of interest.
- ℹ️ **View Planet Information:** Detailed information about planets, moons, and celestial bodies is accessible, including mass, radius, surface features, and orbital parameters.
